University of Windsor Problem of the Week Leaderboards
========================================================

POTW will once again be live this September! Stay tuned...


About
-------------

Each week the Computer Science Society comes up with a new computer science related problem dubbed 
the "Problem of the week". Students who solve said problem recieve a ballot that is entered for a 
draw at the end of the month where they can win some pretty sweet prizes. This web-app was created 
to help make the process easier for all those involved (solvers and checkers) and hopefully get 
more students involved.


Install
-------------
```
./setup.sh
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Testing
-------------
This repo has been recently updated for Python 3. To run, you will most likely need the following 
versions *or newer* to successfully compile:

* Python 3.6.2
* Django 1.11.4
* Pip 9.0.1

For the older Django / Python 2 version, see 
[this commit](https://github.com/Quinny/uWindsor-POTW-Leaderboard/commit/6d2a04290eb56f475b04bd4ff7fa0c7c2888441d).
