University of Windsor Problem of the Week Leaderboards
========================================================

POTW will once again be live this September! Stay tuned...

About
---------

Each week the Computer Science Society comes up with a new computer science related problem dubbed the "Problem of the week."

Students who solve said problem recieve a ballot that is entered for a draw at the end of the month where they can win some pretty sweet prizes.

This web-app was created to help make the process easier for all those involved (solvers and checkers) and hopefully get more students involved.

Testing
-------------
This repo has been recently updated for Python 3. To run, you will most likely need the following versions *or newer* to
